# Autonomous Digital Asset and Domain Discovery System

## Overview

This system features three fully autonomous AI bots that collaborate and compete to discover digital assets, domains, and hidden correlations using advanced machine learning and distributed orchestration patterns.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **BotOrchestrator** - Central coordination system
2. **AutonomousBot** - Base class with self-healing and adaptive capabilities
3. **DomainHunterBot** - Domain discovery and analysis specialist
4. **AssetSeekerBot** - Digital asset correlation expert with ML capabilities
5. **RecursiveExplorerBot** - Deep boundary-pushing exploration engine
6. **Real-time Dashboard** - Live monitoring and control interface

### Autonomous Features

#### Self-Initiation and Adaptive Strategies
- **Autonomous Task Generation**: Each bot generates its own tasks based on current strategy and performance
- **Dynamic Strategy Adaptation**: Bots adjust their approach based on discovery success rates
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Adaptive intervals based on performance metrics (10s to 2min range)
- **Resource Optimization**: Automatic task load balancing and concurrent execution limits

#### Collaborative and Competitive Behavior
- **Discovery Broadcasting**: All discoveries are shared between bots for collaborative analysis
- **Relevance Scoring**: Each bot calculates relevance of other bots' discoveries to its domain
- **Competition Mechanisms**: Bots compete for optimal territory coverage while avoiding overlap
- **Task Redistribution**: Orchestrator redistributes tasks every minute to maximize coverage

#### Self-Healing and Persistence

```javascript
// Via API
fetch('/api/deep-whisper', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        discovery: {
            type: 'manual-trigger',
            assetMovementPattern: true,
            obscureDomainOwnership: true,
            blockchainCrossLinks: true,
            hiddenAssetClusters: true
        }
    })
});
```

```javascript
// Get real-time metrics
const response = await fetch('/api/metrics');
const metrics = await response.json();

console.log(`Total Discoveries: ${metrics.systemMetrics.totalDiscoveries}`);
console.log(`Active Collaborations: ${metrics.systemMetrics.collaborations}`);
```

## Advanced Features for Power Users

### Custom Discovery Triggers
Advanced users can configure custom triggers for Deep Whisper scans by modifying the orchestrator's `shouldTriggerDeepWhisper` method.

### Bot Strategy Customization
Each bot's strategy can be customized through the adaptive strategy system:
```javascript
bot.adaptStrategy([
    { type: 'searchScope', value: 'expanded' },
    { type: 'collaborationLevel', value: 'high' },
    { type: 'riskTolerance', value: 'aggressive' }
]);
```

### Custom Correlation Patterns
The Asset Seeker bot can be extended with custom correlation detection patterns for specific use cases.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Bots Not Starting**: Check logs for initialization errors, verify dependencies
2. **Low Discovery Rate**: Adjust bot strategies or check external API connectivity
3. **Dashboard Not Loading**: Verify WebSocket connection and port accessibility
4. **Deep Whisper Not Triggering**: Check confidence thresholds and correlation quality

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed logging and error information.

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust `autonomousInterval` for each bot based on resource constraints
- Optimize `maxConcurrentTasks` based on system capabilities
- Configure `discoveryCache` size based on memory availability
