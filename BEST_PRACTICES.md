# Best Practices Cheat Sheet

## 1. Python Code Quality

- **Use Linters**: Integrate tools like `pylint` or `flake8` to catch errors and enforce style.
- **Type Annotations**: Use type hints for function signatures and variables.
- **Follow PEP 8**: Stick to official Python style guidelines.
- **Write Tests**: Use `pytest` or `unittest` for thorough test coverage.
- **Avoid Code Duplication**: Use functions and modules to reuse logic.
- **Document Code**: Use docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

## 2. GitHub Actions & Workflows

- **Pin Action Versions**: Use fixed versions (e.g., `@v2.0.0`) for reliability.
- **Use Matrix Builds**: Test across multiple Python versions and OSes.
- **Cache Dependencies**: Speed up CI using cache actions.
- **Fail Fast**: Set up jobs to fail on errors, and use `continue-on-error: false`.
- **Artifacts & Logs**: Upload test results and logs for debugging.
- **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive values.

## 3. Writing Workflows

- **Keep Steps Atomic**: Each step should do one thing (e.g., install, lint, test).
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name jobs and steps clearly.
- **Optimize for Speed**: Use caching, parallel jobs, and minimal environments.
- **Use Conditionals**: Only run jobs/steps when necessary (`if:`).
- **Auto-format Code**: Integrate tools like `black` or `autopep8`.

## 4. Security

- **Least Privilege**: Restrict permissions for workflows and tokens.
- **Dependabot Alerts**: Enable automated security updates.
- **Review Third-party Actions**: Audit external actions before use.
- **Secrets Rotation**: Regularly change and audit secrets.
- **Static Analysis**: Use security scanners (e.g., `bandit` for Python).
- **Branch Protection**: Require reviews and CI passes before merging.

## 5. General Software Engineering

- **Version Control**: Use feature branches and pull requests for changes.
- **Code Reviews**: Always review code before merging.
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate tests in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date README and usage docs.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues for bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Refactor code and workflows regularly.

## 6. GitHub Copilot Best Practices

- **Review AI Suggestions**: Always review and understand code suggestions before accepting
- **Test AI-Generated Code**: Thoroughly test any code generated by AI assistants
- **Maintain Context**: Provide clear comments and context for better AI suggestions
- **Security First**: Never let AI suggestions bypass security validations
- **Code Style**: Ensure AI suggestions match your project's coding standards
- **Documentation**: AI-generated code should be well-documented and maintainable

### Working with Copilot in This Project

- **Payment Code**: Always validate Stripe-related suggestions against official documentation
- **Security Headers**: Verify that security configurations remain intact
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure secrets are never hardcoded in suggestions
- **Error Handling**: AI suggestions should include proper error handling
- **Testing**: Add test cases for AI-generated functionality

### Copilot Prompt Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: "Add input validation for email field" vs "validate input"
- **Include Context**: Mention the framework, libraries, or patterns being used
- **Security Focus**: Explicitly request security considerations
- **Error Handling**: Request error handling in complex operations
- **Performance**: Ask for performance considerations when relevant
